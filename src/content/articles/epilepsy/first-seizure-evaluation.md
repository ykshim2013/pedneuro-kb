## Initial Assessment

### Red Flags Requiring Emergent Evaluation

When a child presents after a first seizure, the following features mandate **emergent evaluation** including neuroimaging (CT initially, MRI when stable):

- Prolonged postictal state (>30 minutes)
- Persistent focal neurological deficit
- Signs of elevated intracranial pressure (headache, vomiting, papilledema)
- History of significant head trauma
- Age < 6 months with symptomatic seizure
- Immunocompromised state
- Concern for child abuse
- New focal findings on neurological examination

### Key History Elements

| Question | Clinical Significance |
|----------|----------------------|
| Seizure description (type, duration, focal features) | Classification and localization |
| Was there any warning or aura? | Suggests focal onset |
| Where did movements start? | Helps localize seizure origin |
| Was there loss of awareness? | Focal vs generalized |
| Postictal state (duration, weakness, confusion) | Todd's paralysis suggests focal seizure |
| Preceding illness, fever, triggers | Provoked vs unprovoked |
| Developmental history | DEE or underlying brain abnormality |
| Family history of seizures/epilepsy | Genetic epilepsy syndromes |
| Medication or toxin exposure | Provoked seizure |

## Diagnostic Workup

### Immediate Workup (Emergency Department)

| Test | Indication |
|------|-----------|
| Bedside glucose | All first seizures |
| Electrolytes (Na, Ca, Mg) | If metabolic cause suspected |
| CBC | If infection suspected |
| Toxicology screen | If altered mental status or suspicion |
| CT head | **Only if red flags present** — NOT routine for uncomplicated first seizure |

> **Key Principle**: Routine blood tests are **NOT recommended** for well-appearing children who have returned to baseline after a simple first unprovoked seizure ([Hirtz et al., *Neurology*, 2000](https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.55.5.616)).

### Outpatient Workup (Within 1-2 weeks)

| Test | Details |
|------|---------|
| **EEG** | Routine EEG; if normal, consider sleep-deprived EEG (increased sensitivity) |
| **MRI brain** | Epilepsy protocol (thin coronal FLAIR through hippocampi) |
| Developmental assessment | Formal evaluation if any concerns |

### Extended Workup (If indicated)

| Test | When to Consider |
|------|-----------------|
| Video-EEG monitoring | Uncertain seizure diagnosis, pre-surgical evaluation |
| Genetic testing | Early onset (<2 years), refractory seizures, DEE phenotype |
| Metabolic studies | Developmental regression, unexplained encephalopathy |
| Lumbar puncture with CSF studies | Suspected infection, GLUT1 deficiency (CSF glucose) |

## EEG After First Seizure

- **Abnormal EEG** after a first unprovoked seizure increases recurrence risk to ~60% → meets ILAE criteria for epilepsy diagnosis ([Fisher et al., *Epilepsia*, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.12550))
- **Normal EEG** does not exclude epilepsy — sensitivity of a single routine EEG is only ~50%
- **Sleep-deprived EEG** increases sensitivity by 20-30%
- **Timing**: EEG within 24 hours of seizure has the highest yield for capturing epileptiform discharges

## Neuroimaging

### When to Image

- **Emergent CT**: Red flags present (see above)
- **MRI brain**: Recommended for all children with a first unprovoked seizure as part of outpatient workup
- **Not required**: Simple febrile seizure in a well-appearing child

### Epilepsy MRI Protocol

A standard epilepsy MRI should include:
- Thin-cut coronal FLAIR through hippocampi (mesial temporal sclerosis)
- 3D T1 volumetric sequence (cortical dysplasia)
- T2/FLAIR axial and coronal (tubers, gliosis)
- Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI — calcification, blood products)
- Post-contrast if tumor or infection suspected

## When to Order Genetic Testing

Genetic testing should be considered when any of the following features are present (Pohlmann-Eden et al., *CNS Drugs*, 2024):

| Feature | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| Seizure onset < 2 years | Higher yield of genetic diagnosis |
| Refractory to ≥2 ASMs | Suggests genetic etiology with specific treatment implications |
| Developmental regression or plateau | DEE or metabolic disorder |
| Family history of epilepsy | Autosomal dominant epilepsy syndromes |
| Dysmorphic features | Syndromic epilepsy |
| Specific EEG patterns | Burst-suppression, hypsarrhythmia |

### Genetic Testing Pathway

**Step 1**: Chromosomal microarray (detects CNVs; yield ~5-10%)

**Step 2**: Epilepsy gene panel (specific phenotype) or Whole Exome Sequencing/trio (unknown etiology; yield ~30%)

**Step 3**: Whole Genome Sequencing, RNA sequencing, or functional studies (if Steps 1-2 negative)

> Finding a genetic cause changes management in ~36% of DEE patients — including medication selection, avoidance of contraindicated drugs, and eligibility for precision therapies ([Symonds et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awz195)).

## Recurrence Risk After First Seizure

| Risk Factor | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Abnormal EEG | ↑ risk to ~60% (meets epilepsy criteria) |
| Prior brain injury or abnormality | ↑ risk |
| Nocturnal seizure | ↑ risk |
| Prolonged postictal Todd's paralysis | Suggests focal lesion |
| Normal EEG + normal MRI | Lower risk (~30-40% overall 2-year recurrence) |

## When to Start Antiseizure Medication

- **After a single unprovoked seizure**: Treatment is **optional** — discuss risk-benefit with family
- **Consider starting treatment if**: Abnormal EEG, abnormal MRI, nocturnal seizure, strong family history, high-risk features
- **Definite treatment indication**: ≥2 unprovoked seizures, or single seizure with ≥60% recurrence risk (meets epilepsy definition)

## Comprehensive Phenotyping Checklist

When evaluating a child after a first seizure, systematically assess:

**Growth Parameters:**
- Head circumference (microcephaly or macrocephaly)
- Height/weight trajectory

**Craniofacial Examination:**
- Skull shape, fontanelles, sutures
- Eye spacing, ear position, philtrum, palate

**Skin Examination (Neurocutaneous Markers):**
- Hypopigmented macules (TSC — use Wood's lamp)
- Cafe-au-lait spots (NF1 — ≥6 spots)
- Port-wine stain in V1 distribution (Sturge-Weber)

**Neurological Examination:**
- Tone, reflexes, strength
- Developmental level assessment
- Gait and coordination

## Key Points

- Not all first seizures require emergent neuroimaging — CT head is indicated only when red flags are present ([Hirtz et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.55.5.616))
- EEG and MRI brain should be obtained as part of outpatient workup for all first unprovoked seizures
- An abnormal EEG after a first seizure increases recurrence risk to ~60%, meeting ILAE criteria for epilepsy diagnosis ([Fisher et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.12550))
- Routine blood tests are NOT recommended for well-appearing children after a first uncomplicated seizure
- Genetic testing is increasingly important in early-onset and refractory epilepsy, with management-changing yield in ~36% of DEE patients
- Treatment after a single seizure is optional — decision should involve shared decision-making with the family
- Systematic phenotyping including skin examination (neurocutaneous markers) should be performed in every case
