## Overview

Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) caused primarily by loss-of-function mutations in **SCN1A**, encoding the Nav1.1 voltage-gated sodium channel. It is one of the most clinically important genetic epilepsies due to its specific medication safety requirements.

## Epidemiology

- **Incidence**: ~1 in 12,200 live births (Symonds et al., *Brain*, 2019)
- **Genetics**: >85% caused by SCN1A pathogenic variants; ~90% are de novo
- **Sex ratio**: Males slightly more commonly affected

## Pathophysiology

SCN1A encodes the Nav1.1 sodium channel, which is predominantly expressed in **GABAergic inhibitory interneurons**:

1. Loss-of-function SCN1A mutations → Reduced Nav1.1 function in inhibitory neurons
2. Impaired inhibitory neuron firing → Loss of inhibition
3. Excitation-inhibition imbalance → Seizures and developmental impairment

This mechanism explains why **sodium channel blockers worsen seizures** in Dravet syndrome — they further impair the already-compromised inhibitory neuron function.

## Clinical Features

### Seizure History
- **Onset**: 5-8 months of age (typically first year)
- **First seizure**: Prolonged (>15 min), often hemiclonic, triggered by fever
- **Early course**: Seizures initially appear febrile → later also afebrile
- **Seizure types**: Hemiclonic, generalized tonic-clonic, myoclonic, atypical absence, focal seizures
- **Status epilepticus**: Frequent, a defining feature
- **Triggers**: Fever, warm baths, exertion, photosensitivity

### Development
- **First year**: Typically normal development
- **Second year onward**: Developmental plateau followed by regression in many patients
- **Intellectual disability**: Present in majority; severity varies
- **Gait abnormalities**: Crouch gait develops in adolescence/adulthood
- **SUDEP risk**: Elevated (estimated 5-10% lifetime risk)

> **Diagnostic Pearl**: "Fever + prolonged seizure in infant → Think SCN1A." A first febrile seizure that is prolonged (>15 min), hemiclonic, or followed by clustering should raise high suspicion for Dravet syndrome → Order SCN1A testing early.

## Medication Safety

### Medications to AVOID (Can worsen seizures and provoke status epilepticus)

**Sodium Channel Blockers** — CONTRAINDICATED:
- Phenytoin / Fosphenytoin
- Carbamazepine
- Oxcarbazepine
- Lamotrigine
- Lacosamide
- Rufinamide
- Eslicarbazepine

**Other Medications to Avoid**:
- Vigabatrin
- Tiagabine
- Pregabalin
- Gabapentin

> **In Status Epilepticus**: Use benzodiazepines (lorazepam, midazolam, diazepam) and IV valproate. **AVOID phenytoin/fosphenytoin even in emergency settings.**

### Recommended Treatments

**First-line:**
- **Valproate** + **Clobazam** (combination is standard initial therapy)

**FDA-approved add-on therapies:**

| Drug | Brand | Mechanism | Key Evidence |
|------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Stiripentol** | Diacomit | GABA-A potentiation | FDA-approved 2018; effective add-on to VPA + CLB |
| **Cannabidiol** | Epidiolex | Multiple (GPR55, TRPV1, adenosine) | Phase 3 trial: 43% reduction in convulsive seizure frequency vs 27% placebo (Devinsky et al., *Lancet*, 2017) |
| **Fenfluramine** | Fintepla | Serotonin release, sigma-1 agonist | Phase 3 trial: 54% median reduction in monthly convulsive seizure frequency vs 5% placebo; 68% responder rate (Lagae et al., *JAMA Neurology*, 2023) |

**Other options:**
- Topiramate (add-on)
- Ketogenic diet (effective in ~50-60% of cases)
- Vagus nerve stimulation

## SCN1A vs KCNQ2: Opposite Treatment Strategies

This comparison illustrates the critical importance of genetic diagnosis before medication selection:

| Feature | SCN1A (Dravet) | KCNQ2 Epilepsy |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Affected channel | Nav1.1 (sodium) | Kv7.2 (potassium) |
| Mutation effect | Loss of function in inhibitory neurons | Loss or gain of function |
| Na+ channel blockers | **CONTRAINDICATED** — worsen seizures | **First-line** — often effective |
| Consequence of wrong treatment | Status epilepticus, potential fatality | Treatment failure, delayed response |
| First-line ASM | Valproate + Clobazam | Carbamazepine, Oxcarbazepine |

## Emerging Therapies

### Antisense Oligonucleotides (ASO)
- **Zorevunersen**: ASO targeting SCN1A using TANGO (Targeted Augmentation of Nuclear Gene Output) approach
- **Mechanism**: Blocks inhibitory regulatory elements in SCN1A pre-mRNA → upregulates Nav1.1 protein expression
- **Status**: Phase 3 clinical trials ongoing

### Gene Therapy
- **ETX101** (Encoded Therapeutics): AAV-delivered gene therapy for Dravet
- Targets SCN1A expression specifically in inhibitory neurons
- Status: Phase 1/2 clinical trials

### Gene Editing (CRISPR)
- dCas9-mediated promoter activation to upregulate SCN1A expression
- Status: Preclinical (mouse models show promise)
- Challenges: CNS delivery, immune response to Cas9, off-target effects

## Prognosis and Long-Term Outcomes

- **Seizure control**: Most patients have lifelong drug-resistant epilepsy
- **Cognitive outcome**: Variable; ranging from mild to severe intellectual disability
- **Motor**: Progressive gait abnormalities (crouch gait) in many patients
- **SUDEP**: Significant risk (~15x general epilepsy population)
- **Life expectancy**: Reduced, though improving with modern management (Wirrell et al., 2022)

## Key Points

- Dravet syndrome is caused by SCN1A loss-of-function mutations affecting inhibitory interneurons, with an incidence of ~1:12,200 (Symonds et al., 2019)
- Sodium channel blockers (phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, lacosamide) are **contraindicated** — they worsen seizures and can trigger status epilepticus
- First-line treatment is valproate + clobazam; three FDA-approved add-on therapies exist (stiripentol, cannabidiol, fenfluramine)
- Fenfluramine showed 54% median seizure reduction in phase 3 trials (Lagae et al., 2023)
- "Fever + prolonged hemiclonic seizure in infant" should trigger early SCN1A genetic testing
- SCN1A vs KCNQ2 demonstrates why genetic diagnosis BEFORE medication selection is critical for patient safety
- Emerging therapies (ASO, gene therapy, CRISPR) target the underlying molecular defect and are in clinical trials
