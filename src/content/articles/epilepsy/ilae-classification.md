## Core Definitions

**Seizure**: Transient signs/symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.

**Epilepsy** (Fisher et al., *Epilepsia*, 2014):
- ≥2 unprovoked seizures occurring >24 hours apart, OR
- 1 unprovoked seizure with a recurrence risk ≥60% over the next 10 years, OR
- Diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome

**Status Epilepticus**: Seizure lasting >5 minutes OR multiple seizures without full recovery between them.

## Three Levels of Diagnosis (ILAE 2017)

The ILAE 2017 framework (Scheffer et al., *Epilepsia*, 2017) established a three-tiered diagnostic approach:

| Level | Classification | Description |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Level 1** | Seizure Type | Focal, Generalized, or Unknown onset |
| **Level 2** | Epilepsy Type | Focal, Generalized, Combined, or Unknown |
| **Level 3** | Epilepsy Syndrome | Specific syndromes (e.g., Dravet, CAE, JME) |

At each level, **etiology** should be considered: structural, genetic, infectious, metabolic, immune, or unknown.

## Seizure Classification (ILAE 2017)

### Onset-Based Classification

Seizures are classified by onset (Fisher et al., *Epilepsia*, 2017):

**Focal Onset** → **Generalized Onset** → **Unknown Onset**

### Focal Seizure Features

| Feature | Options | Clinical Significance |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| **Awareness** | Retained / Impaired | Replaces older "simple" vs "complex partial" terminology |
| **Motor Onset** | Automatisms, Atonic, Clonic, Tonic, Hyperkinetic, Myoclonic, Spasms | Helps localize seizure origin |
| **Non-Motor Onset** | Autonomic, Behavior arrest, Cognitive, Emotional, Sensory | Suggests specific cortical regions |
| **Progression** | Focal to bilateral tonic-clonic | Previously termed "secondary generalization" |

### Generalized Seizure Types

**Motor:**
- Tonic-clonic
- Tonic
- Clonic
- Myoclonic
- Myoclonic-tonic-clonic
- Myoclonic-atonic
- Atonic
- Epileptic spasms

**Non-Motor (Absence):**
- Typical absence
- Atypical absence
- Myoclonic absence
- Eyelid myoclonia with absence

## Epilepsy Syndromes by Age of Onset

The 2022 ILAE Task Force (Specchio et al., *Epilepsia*, 2022) provided updated definitions and classification of childhood epilepsy syndromes:

### Neonates and Infants (0-2 years)

| Syndrome | Prognosis | Key Features |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Self-limited neonatal epilepsy | Good | Seizures resolve within weeks |
| Self-limited familial neonatal epilepsy | Good | Autosomal dominant, often KCNQ2 |
| Early infantile DEE (Ohtahara syndrome) | Severe | Burst-suppression on EEG |
| Epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS) | Severe | Migrating focal seizures, often KCNT1 |
| Infantile spasms (West syndrome) | Variable | Hypsarrhythmia, developmental regression |
| Dravet syndrome | Severe | SCN1A, fever-sensitive, refractory |

### Childhood (2-12 years)

**Self-Limited Focal Epilepsies:**

| Syndrome | Prognosis | Key Features |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (SLECTS/Rolandic) | Excellent | Centrotemporal spikes, sleep-related |
| Panayiotopoulos syndrome | Excellent | Autonomic seizures, occipital onset |
| Childhood occipital visual epilepsy | Good | Visual symptoms at onset |

**Generalized Epilepsies:**

| Syndrome | Prognosis | Key Features |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) | Good (~70% remission) | 3 Hz spike-wave, hyperventilation activates |
| Epilepsy with myoclonic absences | Variable | Rhythmic myoclonic jerks during absence |
| Epilepsy with eyelid myoclonia (Jeavons) | Often lifelong | Eyelid myoclonia ± absence, photosensitive |

**Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies:**

| Syndrome | Prognosis | Key Features |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Lennox-Gastaut syndrome | Severe, refractory | Slow spike-wave, multiple seizure types |
| Epileptic encephalopathy with spike-and-wave activation in sleep (EE-SWAS) | Cognitive impact | Cognitive regression, NREM-activated discharges |

### Adolescence (12-18 years)

| Syndrome | Prognosis | Key Features |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) | Often lifelong treatment | Less frequent but longer absences than CAE |
| Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) | Lifelong treatment | Morning myoclonus, polyspike-wave on EEG |
| Epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone | Variable | GTC without other seizure types |

## Seizure Semiology: What to Observe

### Seizure Observation Timeline

**Pre-ictal Phase:**
- What was the patient doing before the seizure?
- Any warning or aura? (suggests focal onset)
- Triggers? (fever, sleep deprivation, photic stimulation)

**Ictal Phase:**
- Where did the movements start? (localization)
- What was the sequence/progression? (seizure propagation)
- Was there loss of awareness? (focal vs. generalized)
- What type of movements? (tonic, clonic, myoclonic, atonic)
- Duration of each phase?

**Post-ictal Phase:**
- Confusion duration?
- Focal weakness (Todd's paralysis)?
- Sleep?
- Speech difficulties?

### Seizure History Checklist

| Question | Clinical Significance |
|----------|----------------------|
| What was the patient doing before? | Identify triggers |
| Was there any warning (aura)? | Suggests focal onset |
| Where did movements start? | Localization |
| What was the sequence? | Seizure propagation pattern |
| Was there loss of awareness? | Focal vs generalized |
| How long did each phase last? | Severity assessment |
| What was the postictal state? | Todd's paralysis, confusion |
| Any triggers? | Fever, sleep deprivation, photic |
| Family history? | Genetic epilepsy syndromes |

## Key Points

- The ILAE 2017 framework classifies epilepsy at three levels: seizure type, epilepsy type, and epilepsy syndrome (Scheffer et al., 2017)
- Epilepsy can now be diagnosed after a single unprovoked seizure if recurrence risk is ≥60% (Fisher et al., 2014)
- "Simple partial" and "complex partial" terminology has been replaced by focal seizures with retained or impaired awareness
- "Secondary generalization" is now termed "focal to bilateral tonic-clonic"
- The 2022 ILAE Task Force provided updated definitions for childhood epilepsy syndromes with standardized diagnostic criteria (Specchio et al., 2022)
- Age of onset is critical for syndrome identification: neonatal DEEs carry the worst prognosis, while self-limited childhood focal epilepsies have excellent outcomes
- Etiology (structural, genetic, infectious, metabolic, immune, unknown) should be considered at every diagnostic level
