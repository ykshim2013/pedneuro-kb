## The Precision Medicine Paradigm

Traditional epilepsy treatment follows an empirical approach — selecting antiseizure medications (ASMs) based on seizure type and epilepsy syndrome. Precision medicine transforms this by targeting the **underlying molecular mechanism** identified through genetic testing ([Demarest & Brooks-Kayal, *Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol*, 2024](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-032324-124944)).

**Empirical approach**: Seizure type → ASM selection → Trial and error

**Precision approach**: Genetic diagnosis → Molecular mechanism → Targeted therapy

## Gene-Specific Treatment Strategies

### SCN1A — Dravet Syndrome

**Mechanism**: Loss of Nav1.1 function in inhibitory interneurons

| Category | Medications |
|----------|------------|
| **AVOID** (contraindicated) | Phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, lacosamide, rufinamide |
| **First-line** | Valproate + Clobazam |
| **FDA-approved add-ons** | Stiripentol, Cannabidiol (Epidiolex), Fenfluramine (Fintepla) |
| **Other options** | Topiramate, ketogenic diet |

Fenfluramine demonstrated 54% median reduction in monthly convulsive seizure frequency in phase 3 trials ([Lagae et al., *JAMA Neurology*, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2022.3916)).

### KCNQ2 — KCNQ2 Epilepsy

**Mechanism**: Loss of Kv7.2 potassium channel function (or gain-of-function in some variants)

| Category | Medications |
|----------|------------|
| **First-line** | Sodium channel blockers: Carbamazepine, Oxcarbazepine, Phenytoin |
| **Rationale** | Different pathophysiology from Dravet — Na+ blockers are often effective |
| **Response** | Often rapid and good response in self-limited form |

> **Critical Teaching Point**: SCN1A and KCNQ2 require **opposite** treatment strategies. This is the most important example of why genetic diagnosis before medication selection can prevent harm.

### SLC2A1 — GLUT1 Deficiency Syndrome

**Mechanism**: Impaired glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier

| Category | Treatment |
|----------|----------|
| **Treatment of choice** | **Ketogenic diet** — bypasses the glucose transport defect by providing ketones as alternative brain fuel |
| **ASM limitations** | Standard ASMs have limited efficacy |
| **Avoid** | Valproate (may further impair GLUT1 function) |

**Diagnostic clue**: Low CSF glucose with normal blood glucose (CSF:blood glucose ratio <0.4)

### TSC1/TSC2 — Tuberous Sclerosis Complex

**Mechanism**: Loss of TSC1/TSC2 function → mTOR pathway hyperactivation

| Category | Treatment |
|----------|----------|
| **Targeted therapy** | mTOR inhibitors: Everolimus (FDA-approved), Sirolimus |
| **Infantile spasms** | Vigabatrin (first-line, Level A evidence) |
| **Refractory seizures** | Everolimus — EXIST-3 postextension: 57.7% seizure response rate at 2 years ([Franz et al., *Epilepsia*, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.17099)) |

### SCN2A — Gain vs Loss of Function

SCN2A mutations require careful variant interpretation because treatment depends on functional effect:

| Variant Type | Age of Onset | Treatment Approach |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Gain-of-function** | Neonatal (<3 months) | Sodium channel blockers often effective |
| **Loss-of-function** | Later onset (>3 months) | Sodium channel blockers may worsen; avoid |

This demonstrates that even within a single gene, the **functional consequence** of the specific variant determines treatment.

### KCNT1 — EIMFS and ADNFLE

**Mechanism**: Gain-of-function in KNa1.1 potassium channel

- **Quinidine**: Rationale based on in vitro channel blockade; clinical efficacy has been limited and variable
- **KCNT1-related epilepsy** remains among the most refractory genetic epilepsies

## Emerging Precision Therapies

### Antisense Oligonucleotides (ASO)

**Zorevunersen** (targeting SCN1A/Dravet syndrome):
- Mechanism: TANGO (Targeted Augmentation of Nuclear Gene Output) — blocks inhibitory elements in SCN1A pre-mRNA → upregulates Nav1.1 protein
- Route: Intrathecal injection
- Status: Phase 3 clinical trials
- Potential: First disease-modifying therapy for Dravet syndrome

### Gene Therapy

**ETX101** (Encoded Therapeutics):
- AAV-delivered gene therapy for Dravet syndrome
- Targets SCN1A expression specifically in inhibitory neurons
- Status: Phase 1/2 clinical trials

### CRISPR Gene Editing
- Approach: dCas9-mediated promoter activation to upregulate SCN1A expression
- Status: Preclinical (successful in mouse models)
- Challenges: CNS delivery, immune response to Cas9, off-target effects

### Small Molecule Modulators
- **Ezogabine** (KCNQ2): Kv7 channel opener, compassionate use in severe cases
- **mTOR inhibitors** (TSC1/TSC2): FDA-approved, targeting underlying pathway
- **Ganaxolone** (CDKL5-DEE): Neurosteroid GABA-A modulator, FDA-approved 2022

## Clinical Pearls for Precision Medicine

### Diagnostic Pearls

| Clinical Scenario | Think About | Action |
|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| Fever + prolonged hemiclonic seizure in infant | SCN1A / Dravet | Order SCN1A testing; AVOID Na+ blockers |
| Burst-suppression in neonate | STXBP1, KCNQ2, SCN2A | Urgent genetic panel; consider Na+ blockers for KCNQ2 |
| Seizures only in females + clustering | PCDH19 | X-linked with cellular mosaicism |
| Low CSF glucose, normal blood glucose | SLC2A1 / GLUT1 | Ketogenic diet is treatment of choice |
| Sleep-onset seizures + centrotemporal spikes | SLECTS | Benign; often no treatment needed |
| Staring + 3 Hz spike-wave + hyperventilation | CAE | Ethosuximide or valproate first-line |

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Starting sodium channel blocker without genetic diagnosis in infant epilepsy**: Risk of worsening Dravet syndrome seizures or causing status epilepticus
2. **Misinterpreting normal EEG variants**: Posterior slow of youth, hypnagogic hypersynchrony, and wicket spikes are NORMAL — not epileptiform
3. **Skipping developmental history**: Developmental regression preceding seizure onset is a key feature of DEEs and metabolic disorders
4. **Inadequate family history**: Always obtain a three-generation pedigree — ask about seizures, developmental delay, febrile seizures, and early deaths

## Impact of Genetic Diagnosis on Management

Genetic diagnosis changes clinical management in meaningful ways:

| Change Category | Examples |
|----------------|---------|
| **Medication avoidance** | Na+ blockers in Dravet; valproate in GLUT1 deficiency |
| **Targeted therapy** | Ketogenic diet for GLUT1; mTOR inhibitors for TSC |
| **Prognosis** | Self-limited (PRRT2, KCNQ2-BFNE) vs lifelong (Dravet, LGS) |
| **Genetic counseling** | Recurrence risk, carrier testing, prenatal diagnosis |
| **Clinical trial eligibility** | Gene-specific ASO, gene therapy trials |
| **Surveillance** | Cardiac monitoring in SCN1A (SUDEP risk), renal monitoring in TSC |

## Key Points

- Precision medicine in epilepsy shifts treatment from empirical to mechanism-based, guided by genetic diagnosis ([Demarest & Brooks-Kayal, 2024](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-032324-124944))
- SCN1A (Dravet) vs KCNQ2 is the paradigm example: opposite treatment strategies for different channelopathies
- GLUT1 deficiency (SLC2A1) is uniquely treated with ketogenic diet, which bypasses the glucose transport defect
- mTOR inhibitors (everolimus) are disease-modifying therapy for TSC-associated epilepsy ([Franz et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.17099))
- SCN2A demonstrates that even within a single gene, gain- vs loss-of-function determines treatment approach
- Emerging ASO (zorevunersen), gene therapy (ETX101), and CRISPR approaches are in clinical development for Dravet syndrome
- Genetic diagnosis changes management in ~36% of DEE patients, including medication selection, avoidance of contraindicated drugs, and clinical trial eligibility
