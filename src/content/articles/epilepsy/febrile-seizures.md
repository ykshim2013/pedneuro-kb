## Definition

Febrile seizures (FS) are seizures occurring in children aged 6 months to 5 years, associated with a febrile illness (temperature ≥38°C / 100.4°F), in the absence of central nervous system infection, metabolic disturbance, or history of afebrile seizures. This definition is consistent across most international guidelines, though age cutoffs vary slightly between countries ([Corsello et al., *Pediatric Neurology*, 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2024.03.024)).

## Epidemiology

- **Prevalence**: 2-5% of children in Western countries; up to 8-14% in some Asian populations (particularly Japan and Guam)
- **Peak incidence**: 12-18 months of age
- **Male-to-female ratio**: Slight male predominance (~1.6:1)
- **Family history**: Present in 25-40% of cases (first-degree relatives)
- **Most common neurological disorder in pediatric age** ([Corsello et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2024.03.024))

## Classification

A 2024 systematic review of seven international guidelines (from US, UK, Japan, Mexico, India, and Italy) confirmed that the distinction between simple and complex febrile seizures remains central to management across all countries ([Corsello et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2024.03.024)):

| Feature | Simple Febrile Seizure | Complex Febrile Seizure |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Duration | < 15 minutes | ≥ 15 minutes |
| Type | Generalized tonic-clonic | Focal features |
| Recurrence in 24h | No | Yes (≥1 in 24 hours) |
| Post-ictal | Brief | May be prolonged |
| Frequency | ~80% of febrile seizures | ~20% of febrile seizures |

## Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology of FS involves a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors (Eilbert & Chan, *JACEP Open*, 2022):

1. **Temperature threshold**: Age-dependent vulnerability of the immature brain to fever
2. **Genetic susceptibility**: A 2022 GWAS of 7,635 cases identified seven new FS loci and confirmed four previously reported loci (SCN1A, SCN2A, ANO3, 12q21.33). Variants at two loci relate to fever response genes (PTGER3, IL10), and four other loci harbor neuronal excitability genes (BSN, ERC2, GABRG2, HERC1). Collectively, eleven loci explain 2.8% of variance in liability, with SNP heritability of 10.8% ([Holm et al., *Brain*, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awab260))
3. **Cytokine involvement**: IL-1β and other pro-inflammatory cytokines lower seizure threshold; IL10 locus confirmed as a susceptibility gene
4. **Rate of temperature rise**: May be more important than peak temperature
5. **Positive genetic correlation with epilepsy**: rg = 0.39 (P = 1.68 × 10⁻⁴), suggesting shared genetic architecture ([Holm et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awab260))

## Clinical Evaluation

### History
- Seizure description (type, duration, focal features)
- Fever timeline (onset, peak, source)
- Immunization history (recent vaccinations)
- Developmental history
- Family history of febrile seizures or epilepsy
- Prior febrile seizure episodes

### Physical Examination
- Temperature and vital signs
- Meningeal signs (neck stiffness, Kernig/Brudzinski signs)
- Source of fever identification
- Neurological examination (mental status, focal deficits)
- Fontanelle assessment (in infants)

### When to Perform Lumbar Puncture

> **AAP Guideline (2011, still current)**: LP should be performed when a child with a seizure and fever presents with meningeal signs. LP should also be considered in children pretreated with antibiotics, as meningeal signs may be masked.

- **Strongly consider**: Children < 12 months with incomplete Hib/PCV immunization
- **Consider**: Children 12-18 months, especially if clinically concerning
- **Not routinely indicated**: Children > 18 months with simple febrile seizure and no meningeal signs

A 2024 systematic review confirmed that LP recommendations vary between countries but all guidelines agree on performing LP when meningitis is clinically suspected ([Corsello et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2024.03.024)).

## Investigations

### Routine workup for simple febrile seizures (AAP 2011)
- **Blood tests**: Generally NOT recommended routinely
- **EEG**: NOT recommended after a simple febrile seizure
- **Neuroimaging**: NOT recommended for simple febrile seizures

### Consider for complex febrile seizures
- **Blood work**: CBC, electrolytes, glucose, blood culture if sepsis suspected
- **EEG**: May be considered if focal features or prolonged seizure
- **MRI Brain**: Consider if focal features, developmental delay, or abnormal neurological exam

> **International variation**: A 2024 systematic review found that some guidelines (Japan, India) recommend more extensive workup including EEG for complex FS, while US/UK guidelines are more conservative ([Corsello et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2024.03.024)).

## Management

### Acute Management
1. **Ensure airway patency** and position safely
2. **Most seizures are self-limited** (< 5 minutes)
3. **Benzodiazepines** if seizure > 5 minutes:
   - Rectal diazepam: 0.5 mg/kg (max 20 mg)
   - Intranasal midazolam: 0.2 mg/kg
   - Buccal midazolam: 0.5 mg/kg (preferred in UK guidelines)
   - IV lorazepam: 0.1 mg/kg (if IV access available)
4. **Treat the underlying fever source**

### Antipyretic Therapy
- Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for comfort
- **Does NOT prevent febrile seizure recurrence** — confirmed across all major international guidelines ([Corsello et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2024.03.024); [AAP 2008](https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2008-0939), Level A evidence)

### Prophylactic Anticonvulsant Therapy
- **Continuous prophylaxis**: AAP strongly recommends against routine prophylaxis for simple FS; the potential toxicities outweigh the minimal risks of these benign, self-limited events
- **Intermittent prophylaxis**: Oral diazepam (0.33 mg/kg q8h during febrile illness) may be considered for recurrent FS in some guidelines (Japan, India), though AAP discourages this approach for simple FS
- **International variation**: Japanese guidelines are more permissive of intermittent diazepam prophylaxis, particularly for recurrent FS ([Corsello et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2024.03.024))

### Hospital Admission Criteria
Per the 2024 systematic review, admission criteria vary but typically include ([Corsello et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2024.03.024)):
- Age < 18 months
- Complex febrile seizures
- Prolonged post-ictal state
- Clinical concern for underlying infection

## Prognosis

### Recurrence Risk
- Overall recurrence rate: ~30-35%
- Risk factors for recurrence:
  - Age < 18 months at first seizure
  - Lower temperature at time of seizure
  - Shorter duration of fever before seizure
  - Family history of febrile seizures
  - Multiple complex features

### Risk of Subsequent Epilepsy
- Simple febrile seizures: ~1-2% (slightly above general population risk of ~1%)
- Complex febrile seizures: ~4-6%
- Risk factors: complex features, neurodevelopmental abnormality, family history of epilepsy
- GWAS data show shared genetic architecture between FS susceptibility and epilepsy ([Holm et al., *Brain*, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awab260))

## Key Points

- Febrile seizures are the most common neurological disorder in pediatric age, affecting 2-12% of children
- Simple febrile seizures have an excellent prognosis with no increase in mortality
- Extensive workup is generally unnecessary for simple febrile seizures (AAP 2011)
- Antipyretics do NOT prevent recurrence — confirmed by all major guidelines
- International guidelines show broad consensus but differ on details (LP thresholds, EEG indications, prophylaxis) as shown in the 2024 systematic review
- GWAS studies have identified 11 susceptibility loci involving fever response and neuronal excitability genes
- Parent education and reassurance are critical components of management
