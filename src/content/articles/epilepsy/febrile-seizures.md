## Definition

Febrile seizures are seizures occurring in children aged 6 months to 5 years, associated with a febrile illness (temperature ≥38°C / 100.4°F), in the absence of central nervous system infection, metabolic disturbance, or history of afebrile seizures.

## Epidemiology

- **Prevalence**: 2-5% of children in Western countries; up to 8-14% in some Asian populations
- **Peak incidence**: 12-18 months of age
- **Male-to-female ratio**: Slight male predominance (~1.6:1)
- **Family history**: Present in 25-40% of cases (first-degree relatives)

## Classification

| Feature | Simple Febrile Seizure | Complex Febrile Seizure |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Duration | < 15 minutes | ≥ 15 minutes |
| Type | Generalized | Focal features |
| Recurrence in 24h | No | Yes (≥1 in 24 hours) |
| Post-ictal | Brief | May be prolonged |
| Frequency | ~80% of febrile seizures | ~20% of febrile seizures |

## Pathophysiology

The exact mechanism remains unclear, but likely involves:

1. **Temperature threshold**: Age-dependent vulnerability of the immature brain to fever
2. **Genetic susceptibility**: Multiple susceptibility loci identified (FEB1-FEB11)
3. **Cytokine involvement**: IL-1β and other pro-inflammatory cytokines may lower seizure threshold
4. **Rate of temperature rise**: May be more important than peak temperature

## Clinical Evaluation

### History
- Seizure description (type, duration, focal features)
- Fever timeline (onset, peak, source)
- Immunization history (recent vaccinations)
- Developmental history
- Family history of febrile seizures or epilepsy
- Prior febrile seizure episodes

### Physical Examination
- Temperature and vital signs
- Meningeal signs (neck stiffness, Kernig/Brudzinski signs)
- Source of fever identification
- Neurological examination (mental status, focal deficits)
- Fontanelle assessment (in infants)

### When to Perform Lumbar Puncture

> **AAP Guideline**: LP should be considered in children with febrile seizures who are pretreated with antibiotics, as meningeal signs may be masked.

- **Strongly consider**: Children < 12 months with incomplete immunization
- **Consider**: Children 12-18 months, especially if clinically concerning
- **Not routinely indicated**: Children > 18 months with simple febrile seizure and no meningeal signs

## Investigations

### Routine workup for simple febrile seizures
- **Blood tests**: Generally NOT recommended routinely
- **EEG**: NOT recommended after a simple febrile seizure
- **Neuroimaging**: NOT recommended for simple febrile seizures

### Consider for complex febrile seizures
- **Blood work**: CBC, electrolytes, glucose, blood culture if sepsis suspected
- **EEG**: May be considered if focal features or prolonged seizure
- **MRI Brain**: Consider if focal features, developmental delay, or abnormal neurological exam

## Management

### Acute Management
1. **Ensure airway patency** and position safely
2. **Most seizures are self-limited** (< 5 minutes)
3. **Benzodiazepines** if seizure > 5 minutes:
   - Rectal diazepam: 0.5 mg/kg (max 20 mg)
   - Intranasal midazolam: 0.2 mg/kg
   - IV lorazepam: 0.1 mg/kg (if IV access available)
4. **Treat the underlying fever source**

### Antipyretic Therapy
- Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for comfort
- **Does NOT prevent febrile seizure recurrence** (Level A evidence)

### Prophylactic Anticonvulsant Therapy
- **Continuous prophylaxis**: Generally NOT recommended for simple febrile seizures
- **Intermittent prophylaxis**: Oral diazepam (0.33 mg/kg q8h during febrile illness) may be considered for high-risk patients

## Prognosis

### Recurrence Risk
- Overall recurrence rate: ~30-35%
- Risk factors for recurrence:
  - Age < 18 months at first seizure
  - Lower temperature at time of seizure
  - Shorter duration of fever before seizure
  - Family history of febrile seizures
  - Multiple complex features

### Risk of Subsequent Epilepsy
- Simple febrile seizures: ~1-2% (slightly higher than general population ~1%)
- Complex febrile seizures: ~4-6%
- Risk factors: complex features, neurodevelopmental abnormality, family history of epilepsy

## Key Points

- Febrile seizures are the most common seizure type in childhood
- Simple febrile seizures have an excellent prognosis
- Extensive workup is generally unnecessary for simple febrile seizures
- Antipyretics do NOT prevent recurrence
- Parent education and reassurance are critical components of management
