## Molecular Biology Fundamentals

Understanding genetic testing in clinical practice requires foundational knowledge of molecular biology, from DNA structure to protein function.

### DNA Structure

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the hereditary material that encodes all genetic information:

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Structure** | Double helix — two antiparallel strands |
| **Sugar** | Deoxyribose |
| **Bases** | Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C) |
| **Base pairing** | A-T (2 hydrogen bonds), G-C (3 hydrogen bonds) |
| **Direction** | 5' to 3' (each strand) |
| **Human genome** | ~3.2 billion base pairs, ~20,000 protein-coding genes |
| **Chromosomes** | 23 pairs (22 autosomes + 1 sex chromosome pair) |

  caption="DNA double helix: A-T pairs with 2 hydrogen bonds, G-C pairs with 3 hydrogen bonds. Strands run antiparallel (5'→3')."
  type="diagram"
/>

### Central Dogma: DNA → RNA → Protein

The flow of genetic information follows a defined pathway:

**1. Transcription (DNA → RNA)**
- RNA polymerase reads the template DNA strand (3' to 5')
- Synthesizes messenger RNA (mRNA) in the 5' to 3' direction
- RNA uses uracil (U) instead of thymine (T)
- Pre-mRNA undergoes splicing to remove introns and join exons

**2. Translation (RNA → Protein)**
- Ribosomes read mRNA in triplets called **codons**
- Each codon specifies one amino acid (64 codons → 20 amino acids)
- Start codon: AUG (methionine)
- Stop codons: UAA, UAG, UGA
- Transfer RNA (tRNA) delivers amino acids based on codon-anticodon pairing
- Amino acid chain folds into a functional protein

<ImageViewer

  alt="Central dogma of molecular biology: DNA transcription to mRNA, translation to protein"
  caption="Central Dogma: DNA is transcribed to mRNA (replacing T with U), then translated into protein by ribosomes reading triplet codons."
  type="diagram"
/>

### Gene Structure

| Element | Description | Clinical Relevance |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Exons** | Coding sequences (~1-2% of genome) | Targeted by WES; contain most disease-causing mutations |
| **Introns** | Non-coding sequences between exons | Contain regulatory elements; splice site mutations can be pathogenic |
| **Promoter** | Regulatory region upstream of gene | Mutations can alter gene expression levels |
| **5' UTR** | Untranslated region before start codon | Regulatory; can affect translation efficiency |
| **3' UTR** | Untranslated region after stop codon | mRNA stability, microRNA binding sites |
| **Enhancers** | Distal regulatory elements | Can be thousands of bases from gene; mutations detectable by WGS |

  caption="Gene structure: Exons (coding) are joined during splicing to form mature mRNA. Introns are removed. Only ~1-2% of the genome codes for protein."
  type="diagram"
/>

### Types of Mutations

| Mutation Type | Effect | Example |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| **Missense** | Single amino acid change | SCN1A p.Arg1648His — Dravet syndrome |
| **Nonsense** | Premature stop codon → truncated protein | SCN1A p.Arg580* — Dravet syndrome |
| **Frameshift** | Insertion/deletion shifts reading frame | Dystrophin deletions — DMD |
| **Splice site** | Disrupts intron-exon junction → abnormal splicing | SMN1 — Spinal muscular atrophy |
| **In-frame deletion/insertion** | Loss or gain of amino acids without frame shift | Dystrophin in-frame deletions — Becker MD |
| **Copy number variant (CNV)** | Deletion or duplication of larger DNA segments | 15q11.2 deletion — Angelman syndrome |
| **Trinucleotide repeat expansion** | Expansion of repeated sequence | CGG repeat — Fragile X syndrome |
| **Structural variant** | Large rearrangements (inversions, translocations) | Ring chromosome 20 — epilepsy |

> **Clinical Pearl**: The type of mutation often predicts severity. In dystrophinopathies, out-of-frame deletions cause severe Duchenne MD, while in-frame deletions cause milder Becker MD — the "reading frame rule."

## Chromosomal Analysis Methods

### Karyotype

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **What it detects** | Numerical abnormalities (aneuploidy), large structural rearrangements |
| **Resolution** | ~5-10 Mb (low resolution) |
| **Method** | Metaphase chromosome banding (G-banding) |
| **Turnaround** | 1-2 weeks |
| **Yield in epilepsy** | Low (~2-3%) |
| **Still useful for** | Suspected aneuploidy (Down, Turner), balanced translocations |

### FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization)

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **What it detects** | Targeted detection of specific loci |
| **Resolution** | ~100-200 kb |
| **Method** | Fluorescent probes hybridize to specific chromosomal regions |
| **Turnaround** | 24-72 hours |
| **Use in neurology** | Confirming specific deletions (e.g., 22q11.2, 15q11-13) |
| **Limitation** | Only detects what you target — not genome-wide |

### Chromosomal Microarray (CMA)

CMA is the **first-tier** genetic test recommended by ACMG for children with developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, or multiple congenital anomalies (Manickam et al., *Genetics in Medicine*, 2021).

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **What it detects** | Copy number variants (CNVs): deletions and duplications |
| **Resolution** | ~50-100 kb (50-100x better than karyotype) |
| **Types** | SNP array (also detects UPD, LOH) vs aCGH (array CGH) |
| **Yield in DD/ID** | ~15-20% |
| **Yield in epilepsy** | ~5-10% (Sánchez Fernández et al., *Epilepsia*, 2022) |
| **Turnaround** | 2-4 weeks |
| **Cost** | ~$500-1,500 |

**CMA can detect:**
- Microdeletions/microduplications (submicroscopic CNVs)
- Large CNVs (deletions, duplications)
- Aneuploidy (trisomy, monosomy)
- Uniparental disomy (UPD) — SNP array only
- Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) — SNP array only

**CMA limitations:**
- Cannot detect balanced translocations or inversions
- Cannot detect point mutations (single nucleotide changes)
- Cannot detect trinucleotide repeat expansions
- Low-level mosaicism may be missed (&lt;20-30%)

**Clinically significant CNVs in epilepsy:**

| CNV | Syndrome | Epilepsy Features |
|-----|----------|------------------|
| 15q11.2 deletion | Angelman syndrome | Severe epilepsy, developmental delay |
| 15q13.3 deletion | — | Generalized epilepsy, variable penetrance |
| 16p13.11 deletion | — | Generalized epilepsy, intellectual disability |
| 1q21.1 deletion | — | Variable, developmental delay |
| 22q11.2 deletion | DiGeorge/VCFS | Seizures in ~7% |

  type="diagram"

## Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)

### Gene Panels

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **What it targets** | Curated set of genes (50-500+) associated with a specific phenotype |
| **Method** | Targeted capture and sequencing of selected genes |
| **Yield in epilepsy** | ~15-25% (phenotype-specific panels) |
| **Turnaround** | 4-8 weeks |
| **Cost** | ~$500-2,000 |
| **Advantages** | Faster turnaround, fewer VUS, lower cost, higher coverage per gene |
| **Disadvantages** | Limited to genes on the panel; must choose the right panel for the phenotype |

**Common panel types in pediatric neurology:**

| Panel | Target | Examples |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Epilepsy panel | 100-500+ epilepsy genes | SCN1A, KCNQ2, STXBP1, CDKL5 |
| Neuromuscular panel | NMD genes | DMD, SMN1, LMNA, RYR1 |
| Leukodystrophy panel | White matter disease genes | ASPA, GALC, PLP1 |
| Mitochondrial panel | Nuclear + mtDNA genes | POLG, SURF1, MT-ND genes |

### Whole Exome Sequencing (WES)

WES is now considered a first- or second-tier test for children with suspected genetic conditions (Manickam et al., *Genetics in Medicine*, 2021).

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **What it targets** | All exons (~1-2% of genome, ~20,000 genes) |
| **What it detects** | Single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions/deletions (indels) |
| **Yield in epilepsy/DEE** | ~25-40% (McTague et al., *Lancet Neurology*, 2016) |
| **Yield in undiagnosed disease** | ~25-35% |
| **Trio analysis** | Proband + both parents (preferred for de novo variant detection) |
| **Turnaround** | 8-16 weeks |
| **Cost** | ~$2,000-5,000 |

**WES advantages:**
- Broad coverage of coding regions
- Can identify unexpected genes (not limited by clinical hypothesis)
- Trio analysis enables de novo variant detection
- Re-analysis possible as new gene-disease associations are published

**WES limitations:**

| Limitation | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| Misses non-coding variants | Regulatory, deep intronic variants not captured |
| Poor coverage of GC-rich regions | Some first exons poorly covered |
| Cannot detect structural variants | Large CNVs, inversions missed |
| Cannot detect repeat expansions | Fragile X, Huntington disease missed |
| Generates many VUS | ~40-60% of identified variants are VUS |
| Does not sequence mitochondrial DNA | Separate testing required |

### Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **What it targets** | Entire genome (~3.2 billion bases) including non-coding regions |
| **What it detects** | SNVs, indels, CNVs, structural variants, some repeat expansions |
| **Additional yield over WES** | ~5-10% (Clark et al., *NPJ Genomic Medicine*, 2018) |
| **Turnaround** | 8-16 weeks (rapid WGS: 24-48 hours in some centers) |
| **Cost** | ~$3,000-6,000 |

**WGS advantages over WES:**
- Uniform coverage (no capture bias)
- Detects non-coding regulatory variants
- Better detection of structural variants and CNVs
- Can detect some trinucleotide repeat expansions
- Single test replaces CMA + WES

**WGS limitations:**
- Higher cost
- More variants of uncertain significance (VUS)
- Interpretation of non-coding variants remains challenging
- Larger data storage and analysis requirements
- Incidental findings management

**When to consider WGS over WES:**

| Scenario | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| CMA + WES negative | WGS provides additional yield |
| Suspected structural variant | Better SV detection |
| Suspected non-coding variant | Covers regulatory regions |
| Rapid diagnosis needed (NICU) | Rapid WGS available at select centers |
| Research setting | Comprehensive variant detection |

### Comparison of Genetic Testing Methods

| Feature | Karyotype | CMA | Gene Panel | WES | WGS |
|---------|-----------|-----|-----------|-----|-----|
| **Resolution** | 5-10 Mb | 50-100 kb | Single base | Single base | Single base |
| **Genome coverage** | Whole (low res) | Whole (CNV only) | 50-500 genes | ~20,000 genes | Whole genome |
| **SNVs/Indels** | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **CNVs** | Large only | Yes | Limited | Limited | Yes |
| **SVs** | Large only | No | No | No | Yes |
| **Repeat expansions** | No | No | Targeted | No | Some |
| **Non-coding variants** | No | No | No | No | Yes |
| **Balanced rearrangements** | Yes | No | No | No | Yes |
| **Yield in epilepsy** | 2-3% | 5-10% | 15-25% | 25-40% | 30-45% |
| **Cost** | $300-500 | $500-1,500 | $500-2,000 | $2,000-5,000 | $3,000-6,000 |
| **Turnaround** | 1-2 wk | 2-4 wk | 4-8 wk | 8-16 wk | 8-16 wk |

## Variant Interpretation

### ACMG/AMP Five-Tier Classification

The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) jointly established a standardized framework for variant classification (Richards et al., *Genetics in Medicine*, 2015):

| Class | Interpretation | Clinical Action |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| **Pathogenic** | Disease-causing | Act on this finding |
| **Likely Pathogenic** | &gt;90% probability of being disease-causing | Act on this finding (with appropriate caveats) |
| **Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS)** | Insufficient evidence | Do NOT act on this finding; may reclassify over time |
| **Likely Benign** | &gt;90% probability of being benign | No clinical action |
| **Benign** | Not disease-causing | No clinical action |

> **Critical Principle**: A VUS should **never** be used for clinical decision-making. It means "we don't know yet." Approximately 10-30% of VUS are reclassified over time — families should be counseled about periodic reinterpretation.

  caption="ACMG/AMP 5-tier variant classification (Richards et al., 2015). VUS should NEVER drive clinical decisions — approximately 10-30% are reclassified over time."
  type="diagram"
/>

### Key Evidence Types for Variant Classification

| Evidence Category | Examples |
|-------------------|---------|
| **Population data** | Variant frequency in gnomAD, ExAC databases |
| **Computational predictions** | SIFT, PolyPhen-2, CADD scores, splice predictors |
| **Functional data** | In vitro assays, animal models, electrophysiology |
| **Segregation** | Co-segregation with disease in family |
| **De novo status** | Confirmed absent in parents (trio analysis) |
| **Clinical databases** | ClinVar submissions, HGMD, literature reports |

### Important Databases

| Database | Purpose | URL |
|----------|---------|-----|
| **ClinVar** | Variant-disease associations, classification | ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar |
| **gnomAD** | Population allele frequencies | gnomad.broadinstitute.org |
| **OMIM** | Gene-disease relationships | omim.org |
| **ClinGen** | Gene-disease validity curation | clinicalgenome.org |
| **UniProt** | Protein structure and function | uniprot.org |

## Clinical Genetic Testing Strategy

### When to Order Genetic Testing in Pediatric Neurology

| Indication | Recommended First Test |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Developmental delay / intellectual disability | CMA (first-tier) |
| Autism spectrum disorder | CMA + Fragile X |
| Epilepsy onset &lt; 2 years | Epilepsy gene panel or WES |
| Drug-resistant epilepsy (≥2 ASMs failed) | WES (trio preferred) |
| DEE phenotype | WES (trio preferred) |
| Neuromuscular disease | Specific gene panel or WES |
| Dysmorphic features + seizures | CMA → WES |
| Family history of epilepsy | Targeted testing or gene panel |

### Stepwise Testing Algorithm

**Step 1: Chromosomal Microarray (CMA)**
- First-tier for developmental delay, intellectual disability, ASD
- Also useful as first test in epilepsy with additional features (dysmorphic, DD/ID)
- Yield: ~5-10% in epilepsy, ~15-20% in DD/ID

**Step 2: Gene Panel or Whole Exome Sequencing**
- Specific phenotype (e.g., Dravet-like) → Gene panel (faster, fewer VUS)
- Unknown or broad phenotype → WES trio (broader coverage, ~25-40% yield)
- ACMG 2021 guideline supports WES/WGS as first- or second-tier test (Manickam et al., 2021)

**Step 3: Advanced Testing (if Steps 1-2 negative)**
- Whole Genome Sequencing → detects non-coding variants, SVs
- RNA sequencing → detects aberrant splicing
- Methylation analysis → imprinting disorders (Angelman, Prader-Willi)
- Mitochondrial genome sequencing → mitochondrial disease
- Functional studies → variant characterization

  caption="Clinical genetic testing algorithm: Stepwise approach from CMA (first-tier) through WES/gene panel to WGS, with diagnostic yields at each step."
  type="diagram"
/>

### Practical Considerations

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Turnaround time** | Gene panel (4-8 wk) &lt; CMA (2-4 wk) &lt; WES (8-16 wk) &lt; WGS (8-16 wk); Rapid WGS: 24-48 hrs |
| **Insurance coverage** | CMA widely covered; WES/WGS coverage improving but variable |
| **Genetic counseling** | Essential before and after testing — informed consent, incidental findings management |
| **Re-analysis** | WES/WGS data can be re-analyzed as new gene discoveries are made (every 1-2 years) |
| **Trio vs proband-only** | Trio preferred for de novo detection and variant filtering (reduces candidates ~10-fold) |

### Clinical Impact of Genetic Diagnosis

A genetic diagnosis changes management in approximately **36%** of DEE patients (McTague et al., *Lancet Neurology*, 2016). Specific examples:

| Gene | Clinical Impact of Diagnosis |
|------|----------------------------|
| **SCN1A** (Dravet) | Avoid sodium channel blockers (contraindicated); use VPA + CLB |
| **KCNQ2** | Sodium channel blockers often effective (opposite to SCN1A) |
| **SLC2A1** (GLUT1) | Ketogenic diet is the definitive treatment |
| **TSC1/TSC2** | mTOR inhibitors (everolimus) for seizures and tumors |
| **CDKL5** | Ganaxolone (FDA-approved 2022) |
| **PRRT2** | Low-dose carbamazepine usually effective; excellent prognosis |
| **DEPDC5** | mTOR pathway involvement; surgical candidacy assessment |
| **Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (ALDH7A1)** | Lifelong pyridoxine supplementation |

## Key Points

- The central dogma (DNA → RNA → Protein) underlies all genetic testing — understanding gene structure (exons, introns, regulatory regions) explains why different tests have different yields
- CMA is the ACMG-recommended first-tier test for developmental delay/ID/ASD, detecting CNVs at ~50-100 kb resolution with 5-10% yield in epilepsy (Sánchez Fernández et al., 2022)
- WES targets the ~1-2% of the genome that codes for protein (exons) and has the highest yield in epilepsy/DEE at ~25-40% (McTague et al., 2016)
- WGS covers the entire genome including non-coding regions and provides ~5-10% additional yield over WES (Clark et al., 2018)
- ACMG/AMP 5-tier variant classification (pathogenic to benign) is the standard framework — VUS should never drive clinical decisions (Richards et al., 2015)
- The recommended stepwise approach is CMA → Gene panel/WES → WGS/RNA-seq → Functional studies
- Genetic diagnosis changes management in ~36% of DEE patients, including medication selection, contraindicated drug avoidance, and eligibility for precision therapies
- Trio analysis (proband + both parents) is preferred for WES/WGS as it enables de novo variant detection and reduces candidate variants ~10-fold
