## Genetic Architecture of Epilepsy

Approximately 40% of epilepsies have a significant genetic component ([McTague et al., *Lancet Neurology*, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(15)00250-1)). The genetic architecture spans a spectrum:

**Rare variants (high effect size)**:
- De novo mutations in single genes
- Found by whole exome/genome sequencing (WES/WGS)
- Often cause developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs)
- Examples: SCN1A, KCNQ2, STXBP1

**Common variants (small effect size)**:
- Found by genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
- Contribute to polygenic risk
- Associated with idiopathic/genetic generalized epilepsies (IGE/GGE)
- Cumulative effect determines population risk

Over **800 genes** have been associated with epilepsy, with new genes still being identified ([Wang et al., *Human Genetics*, 2024](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00439-024-02707-x)).

## Major Epilepsy Genes

### Sodium Channel Genes

| Gene | Channel | Phenotype | Prevalence |
|------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **SCN1A** | Nav1.1 | Dravet syndrome, GEFS+ | ~1:12,200 births |
| **SCN2A** | Nav1.2 | Early DEE, BFNIS, ASD | — |
| **SCN8A** | Nav1.6 | Early DEE, intellectual disability | — |

- SCN1A is the most clinically significant epilepsy gene due to medication safety implications (sodium channel blockers are contraindicated)
- SCN2A phenotype depends on mutation type: gain-of-function → neonatal-onset seizures (respond to sodium channel blockers); loss-of-function → later-onset epilepsy with ASD

### Potassium Channel Genes

| Gene | Channel | Phenotype | Prevalence |
|------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **KCNQ2** | Kv7.2 | BFNE, KCNQ2-DEE | ~1:17,000 births |
| **KCNT1** | KNa1.1 | EIMFS, ADNFLE | — |
| **KCNA2** | Kv1.2 | DEE, episodic ataxia | — |

- KCNQ2-related epilepsy: Self-limited form has excellent prognosis; DEE form is severe
- Treatment: Sodium channel blockers are often effective (opposite to SCN1A/Dravet)

### Synaptic Function Genes

| Gene | Function | Phenotype |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **STXBP1** | Vesicle release (syntaxin binding) | Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, DEE |
| **SYNGAP1** | Synaptic plasticity | Intellectual disability with epilepsy |
| **CDKL5** | Kinase signaling | CDKL5-DEE (formerly atypical Rett) |
| **PCDH19** | Cell adhesion | Clustering epilepsy in females |

- PCDH19: X-linked with unique inheritance — affected females (cellular mosaicism) are symptomatic; carrier males are typically unaffected
- STXBP1: Most common genetic cause of Ohtahara syndrome ([Symonds et al., *Brain*, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awz195))

### Other Important Epilepsy Genes

| Gene | Function | Phenotype | Notes |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **PRRT2** | Synaptic protein | PKD, BFIE | ~1:9,970 — most common genetic epilepsy |
| **SLC2A1** | Glucose transporter (GLUT1) | GLUT1 deficiency syndrome | ~1:24,300; ketogenic diet is treatment |
| **TSC1/TSC2** | mTOR pathway | Tuberous sclerosis complex | mTOR inhibitors are treatment |
| **DEPDC5** | mTOR pathway (GATOR1) | Familial focal epilepsy (FFEVF) | Most common cause of familial focal epilepsy |

## Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies (DEEs)

DEEs are conditions where both the underlying etiology AND the epileptic activity independently contribute to developmental impairment ([Scheffer et al., *Epilepsia*, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.13709)).

### DEE Genes by Age of Onset

**Neonatal onset:**
- KCNQ2, STXBP1, SCN2A — often present with burst-suppression on EEG

**Early infantile onset:**
- SCN1A, CDKL5, SCN8A — variable EEG patterns

**Infantile onset:**
- ARX (males), PCDH19 (females), SLC2A1 — hypsarrhythmia possible

### Key DEE Features

| Feature | Significance |
|---------|-------------|
| Early seizure onset (<2 years) | Higher yield from genetic testing |
| Refractory to ≥2 ASMs | Suggests genetic etiology |
| Developmental regression/plateau | Key distinguishing feature from isolated epilepsy |
| Burst-suppression on EEG | STXBP1, KCNQ2, SCN2A |
| Hypsarrhythmia | Infantile spasms — multiple genetic etiologies |

### Incidence Data

A Scottish national cohort study ([Symonds et al., *Brain*, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awz195)) found:
- Overall incidence of childhood-onset genetic epilepsies: **1 in 2,120 live births**
- Most common: PRRT2 (1:9,970), SCN1A (1:12,200), KCNQ2 (1:17,000)
- Genetic diagnosis achieved in **31%** of childhood-onset epilepsy cases
- Yield of genetic testing increases with: earlier onset, refractory seizures, DEE phenotype

## Genetic Testing Strategy

### When to Order Genetic Testing

Testing should be considered when any of the following are present:
- Seizure onset before age 2 years
- Refractory to ≥2 antiseizure medications
- Developmental regression or plateau
- Family history of epilepsy (especially autosomal dominant patterns)
- Dysmorphic features
- Specific EEG patterns (burst-suppression, hypsarrhythmia)

### Testing Algorithm

**Step 1: Chromosomal Microarray**
- Detects copy number variants (CNVs), deletions, duplications, aneuploidy
- Diagnostic yield: ~5-10% in epilepsy

**Step 2: Gene Panel or Whole Exome Sequencing (WES)**
- Specific phenotype → Epilepsy gene panel (faster turnaround, fewer VUS, lower cost)
- Unknown etiology → WES with trio analysis preferred (broader coverage, ~30% yield, more VUS)

**Step 3: Advanced Testing (if Steps 1-2 negative)**
- Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS): Detects non-coding variants
- RNA sequencing: Detects splicing defects
- Functional studies: Variant characterization

> **Clinical Impact**: Finding the genetic cause leads to changes in management in **36%** of DEE patients — including medication choice, avoidance of contraindicated drugs, and eligibility for gene-specific therapies.

## Key Points

- Over 800 genes are associated with epilepsy, with ~40% of epilepsies having a significant genetic component (McTague et al., 2016)
- PRRT2 is the most common genetic epilepsy gene (~1:9,970), followed by SCN1A (~1:12,200) and KCNQ2 (~1:17,000) ([Symonds et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awz195))
- The distinction between SCN1A (sodium channel blockers contraindicated) and KCNQ2 (sodium channel blockers first-line) illustrates why genetic diagnosis before medication selection is critical
- DEEs involve both developmental and epileptic contributions to cognitive impairment — over 800 genes identified
- Genetic testing yield is highest in early-onset, refractory epilepsies with developmental concerns
- Chromosomal microarray → gene panel or WES → WGS/RNA-seq is the recommended stepwise approach
- Genetic diagnosis changes management in approximately one-third of DEE patients
