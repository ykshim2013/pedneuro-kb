## Overview

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common and severe form of muscular dystrophy, caused by mutations in the *DMD* gene leading to absent or severely reduced dystrophin protein. It follows an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern, primarily affecting males (Duan et al., *Nature Reviews Disease Primers*, 2021).

## Epidemiology

- **Incidence**: ~1 in 3,500-5,000 live male births worldwide
- **Prevalence**: ~4.78 per 100,000 males (all ages)
- **De novo mutations**: ~30% of cases have no family history
- **Carrier frequency**: ~1 in 2,500 females

## Genetics

### The DMD Gene
- **Location**: Xp21.2 (short arm of X chromosome)
- **Size**: 2.4 Mb — largest known human gene
- **Protein**: Dystrophin (427 kDa, 3,685 amino acids)
- **79 exons** with 8 independent promoters

### Mutation Types
| Mutation Type | Frequency | Common Locations |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Deletions | ~65-70% | Exons 45-55 (hot spot 1), Exons 2-20 (hot spot 2) |
| Duplications | ~10-15% | Exons 2-20 |
| Point mutations | ~15-20% | Throughout gene |
| Other | ~5% | Splice site, deep intronic |

### Reading Frame Rule
- **Out-of-frame mutations** → DMD (no functional dystrophin)
- **In-frame mutations** → Becker MD (partially functional dystrophin)
- Applies in ~90% of cases (Duan et al., 2021)

## Dystrophin Function

Dystrophin is a critical structural protein in the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DGC):

1. **Mechanical stabilization**: Links intracellular actin cytoskeleton to extracellular matrix
2. **Membrane integrity**: Protects sarcolemma during muscle contraction
3. **Signaling scaffold**: Organizes nNOS and other signaling molecules
4. **Expressed in**: Skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and brain (specific isoforms)

## Clinical Features

### Motor Milestones
- **Early signs**: Delayed walking (mean 18 months, range 12-24+ months)
- **3-5 years**: Progressive proximal weakness, frequent falls, difficulty climbing stairs
- **Gowers' sign**: Classic sign of proximal weakness
- **Pseudohypertrophy**: Calf enlargement due to fatty/fibrous infiltration
- **5-8 years**: Progressive gait abnormalities, toe walking, lumbar lordosis
- **Loss of ambulation**: Typically by age 10-13 years (mean ~10.5 without steroids)

### Cardiac Involvement
- **Onset**: Cardiomyopathy detectable from age 6-7 years
- **Dilated cardiomyopathy**: Progressive, present in nearly all patients by age 18
- **Arrhythmias**: Sinus tachycardia, atrial/ventricular arrhythmias
- **Heart failure**: Leading cause of death

### Respiratory Involvement
- **Restrictive lung disease**: Progressive decline in FVC
- **Nocturnal hypoventilation**: Often the first respiratory symptom
- **Sleep-disordered breathing**: Requires monitoring from loss of ambulation
- **Respiratory failure**: Major cause of mortality

### Cognitive/Behavioral
- **Mean IQ**: ~85 (1 SD below population mean)
- **Learning disabilities**: Present in ~30-50%
- **ADHD/ASD**: Increased prevalence
- **Dp71 isoform**: Brain-specific dystrophin isoform; mutations affecting this correlate with more severe cognitive phenotype (Duan et al., 2021)

## Diagnosis

### Screening and Initial Workup
1. **Serum CK**: Markedly elevated (10,000-100,000+ IU/L; normal < 200)
2. **Genetic testing**: First-line diagnostic approach
   - **MLPA or CGH array**: Detects deletions/duplications (~80% of cases)
   - **Gene sequencing**: If MLPA negative, detects point mutations
   - **RNA analysis**: For unusual or deep intronic variants

### Muscle Biopsy
- Reserved for cases where genetic testing is inconclusive
- **Immunohistochemistry**: Absent dystrophin staining
- **Western blot**: Absent or <3% dystrophin protein

## Management

### Corticosteroids

#### Traditional Corticosteroids
| Parameter | Prednisone/Prednisolone | Deflazacort |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------|
| Dose | 0.75 mg/kg/day | 0.9 mg/kg/day |
| Ambulation prolongation | ~2-3 years | ~2-3 years |
| Weight gain | More | Less |
| Cataracts | Less | More |
| Start age | 4-6 years (while motor function improving) | 4-6 years |

#### Vamorolone (AGAMREE) — FDA Approved October 2023

Vamorolone is a novel dissociative steroidal anti-inflammatory that retains the anti-inflammatory efficacy of traditional corticosteroids while showing improved safety, particularly regarding bone and metabolic side effects.

- **VISION-DMD Trial (Phase 2b)**: Vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day met the primary endpoint of improvement in Time to Stand velocity vs placebo (P = 0.002) at 24 weeks, with similar efficacy to prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day (Guglieri et al., *JAMA Network Open*, 2022)
- **48-Week Extension**: Sustained efficacy with vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day, with advantages over prednisone in safety endpoints including BMI trajectory, bone turnover markers, and adrenal suppression (Dang et al., *Neurology*, 2024)
- **FDA approval**: October 26, 2023, for DMD in patients aged ≥2 years
- **Dose**: 6 mg/kg/day oral suspension
- **Key advantage**: Acts as a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (unlike prednisone), potentially providing cardiovascular benefit

### Cardiac Management (Birnkrant et al., *Lancet Neurology*, 2018)
- **ACE inhibitors or ARBs**: Start by age 10 (or earlier if cardiomyopathy detected)
- **Beta-blockers**: For heart failure management
- **Cardiac MRI**: Annual monitoring from age 10
- **ECG/Echocardiogram**: Annual from diagnosis

### Respiratory Management
- **Pulmonary function tests**: Baseline from age 5-6, every 6-12 months
- **Non-invasive ventilation (NIV)**: When FVC < 50% or sleep hypoventilation
- **Cough assist devices**: Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation
- **Vaccination**: Influenza, pneumococcal, COVID-19

### Rehabilitation
- **Physical therapy**: Stretching, range of motion, submaximal exercise
- **Occupational therapy**: ADL adaptations, upper limb function
- **Orthoses**: AFOs for ankle contractures, standing frames
- **Wheelchair**: Power wheelchair assessment when ambulation declines

## Gene-Targeted Therapies

### Exon Skipping (FDA-Approved Antisense Oligonucleotides)

| Drug | Target | FDA Approval | Applicable Mutations |
|------|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Eteplirsen (Exondys 51) | Exon 51 | 2016 | ~13% of DMD patients |
| Golodirsen (Vyondys 53) | Exon 53 | 2019 | ~8% of DMD patients |
| Viltolarsen (Viltepso) | Exon 53 | 2020 | ~8% of DMD patients |
| Casimersen (Amondys 45) | Exon 45 | 2021 | ~8% of DMD patients |

These first-generation PMO antisense oligonucleotides require weekly IV infusions and typically achieve 1-6% dystrophin restoration. Collectively, they address mutations in ~25-30% of the DMD population.

### Gene Replacement Therapy — Delandistrogene Moxeparvovec (Elevidys)

Delandistrogene moxeparvovec is an AAV-based gene therapy delivering micro-dystrophin:

- **FDA accelerated approval**: June 2023 (ambulatory patients aged 4-5 years)
- **FDA expanded approval**: June 2024 (ambulatory patients aged ≥4 years, traditional approval; non-ambulatory patients aged ≥4 years, accelerated approval)
- **Delivery**: Single IV dose (1.33 × 10¹⁴ vg/kg)
- **EMBARK Phase 3 Trial** (Mendell et al., *Nature Medicine*, 2024):
  - 125 patients treated (63 delandistrogene, 62 placebo)
  - **Primary endpoint NOT met**: Change in NSAA score at week 52 showed no statistically significant difference (LSM 2.57 vs 1.92; P = 0.2441)
  - **Micro-dystrophin expression**: 34.29% at week 12 (vs 0% placebo)
  - **Secondary endpoints**: Trends favoring treatment in Time to Rise, 10-meter Walk/Run, and time to ascend 4 steps
  - **Safety**: 674 adverse events in treatment group (medically manageable); consistent with prior experience

### Pipeline Therapies
- **Next-generation AAV gene therapy**: Optimized micro-dystrophin constructs, full-length dystrophin delivery via triple-AAV vectors (preclinical)
- **CRISPR gene editing**: Exon deletion/reframing strategies (early clinical trials)
- **Utrophin upregulation**: Compensatory protein strategy
- **Anti-fibrotic agents**: Targeting muscle fibrosis

## Prognosis

- **Without treatment**: Death typically in late teens to early 20s from respiratory/cardiac failure
- **With current care**: Survival into 30s-40s with comprehensive multidisciplinary management
- **Quality of life**: Improved with early intervention, assistive technology, and psychosocial support

## Key Points

- DMD is the most common fatal genetic disorder diagnosed in childhood, caused by mutations in the largest human gene
- Serum CK is the initial screening test; genetic testing confirms diagnosis
- Vamorolone (FDA-approved 2023) offers corticosteroid-equivalent efficacy with improved safety profile over prednisone (Guglieri et al., 2022; Dang et al., 2024)
- Delandistrogene moxeparvovec (Elevidys) received expanded FDA approval in 2024 despite the EMBARK phase 3 trial not meeting its primary endpoint (Mendell et al., 2024)
- Four exon-skipping ASOs are FDA-approved, covering ~25-30% of the DMD population
- Multidisciplinary care (cardiac, respiratory, orthopedic, rehabilitation) remains essential for optimizing outcomes
- Carrier females should be screened for cardiac involvement
