## Overview

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common and severe form of muscular dystrophy, caused by mutations in the *DMD* gene leading to absent or severely reduced dystrophin protein. It follows an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern, primarily affecting males.

## Epidemiology

- **Incidence**: ~1 in 3,500-5,000 live male births worldwide
- **Prevalence**: ~4.78 per 100,000 males (all ages)
- **De novo mutations**: ~30% of cases have no family history
- **Carrier frequency**: ~1 in 2,500 females

## Genetics

### The DMD Gene
- **Location**: Xp21.2 (short arm of X chromosome)
- **Size**: 2.4 Mb — largest known human gene
- **Protein**: Dystrophin (427 kDa, 3,685 amino acids)
- **79 exons** with 8 independent promoters

### Mutation Types
| Mutation Type | Frequency | Common Locations |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Deletions | ~65-70% | Exons 45-55 (hot spot 1), Exons 2-20 (hot spot 2) |
| Duplications | ~10-15% | Exons 2-20 |
| Point mutations | ~15-20% | Throughout gene |
| Other | ~5% | Splice site, deep intronic |

### Reading Frame Rule
- **Out-of-frame mutations** → DMD (no functional dystrophin)
- **In-frame mutations** → Becker MD (partially functional dystrophin)
- Applies in ~90% of cases

## Dystrophin Function

Dystrophin is a critical structural protein in the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DGC):

1. **Mechanical stabilization**: Links intracellular actin cytoskeleton to extracellular matrix
2. **Membrane integrity**: Protects sarcolemma during muscle contraction
3. **Signaling scaffold**: Organizes nNOS and other signaling molecules
4. **Expressed in**: Skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and brain (specific isoforms)

## Clinical Features

### Motor Milestones
- **Early signs**: Delayed walking (mean 18 months, range 12-24+ months)
- **3-5 years**: Progressive proximal weakness, frequent falls, difficulty climbing stairs
- **Gowers' sign**: Classic sign of proximal weakness (using hands to climb up legs when rising from floor)
- **Pseudohypertrophy**: Calf enlargement due to fatty/fibrous infiltration
- **5-8 years**: Progressive gait abnormalities, toe walking, lumbar lordosis
- **Loss of ambulation**: Typically by age 10-13 years (mean ~10.5 without steroids)

### Cardiac Involvement
- **Onset**: Cardiomyopathy detectable from age 6-7 years
- **Dilated cardiomyopathy**: Progressive, present in nearly all patients by age 18
- **Arrhythmias**: Sinus tachycardia, atrial/ventricular arrhythmias
- **Heart failure**: Leading cause of death

### Respiratory Involvement
- **Restrictive lung disease**: Progressive decline in FVC
- **Nocturnal hypoventilation**: Often the first respiratory symptom
- **Sleep-disordered breathing**: Requires monitoring from loss of ambulation
- **Respiratory failure**: Major cause of mortality

### Cognitive/Behavioral
- **Mean IQ**: ~85 (1 SD below population mean)
- **Learning disabilities**: Present in ~30-50%
- **ADHD/ASD**: Increased prevalence compared to general population
- **Dp71 isoform**: Brain-specific dystrophin isoform, mutations affecting this correlate with more severe cognitive phenotype

### Other Systems
- **Bone health**: Osteoporosis, fracture risk (compounded by steroid use)
- **GI**: Gastroparesis, constipation, swallowing difficulties
- **Endocrine**: Growth failure, delayed puberty, adrenal insufficiency (steroid-related)

## Diagnosis

### Screening and Initial Workup
1. **Serum CK**: Markedly elevated (10,000-100,000+ IU/L; normal < 200)
2. **Genetic testing**: First-line diagnostic approach
   - **MLPA or CGH array**: Detects deletions/duplications (~80% of cases)
   - **Gene sequencing**: If MLPA negative, detects point mutations
   - **RNA analysis**: For unusual or deep intronic variants

### Muscle Biopsy
- Reserved for cases where genetic testing is inconclusive
- **Immunohistochemistry**: Absent dystrophin staining
- **Western blot**: Absent or <3% dystrophin protein
- **Histopathology**: Fiber size variation, necrosis, regeneration, fibrosis, fatty infiltration

### Newborn Screening
- **CK-based screening**: Implemented in some regions
- Allows earlier diagnosis and family counseling

## Management

### Corticosteroids — Current Standard of Care
| Parameter | Prednisone/Prednisolone | Deflazacort |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------|
| Dose | 0.75 mg/kg/day | 0.9 mg/kg/day |
| Ambulation prolongation | ~2-3 years | ~2-3 years |
| Weight gain | More | Less |
| Bone effects | Moderate | Less |
| Cataracts | Less | More |
| Start age | 4-6 years (while motor function improving) | 4-6 years |

### Cardiac Management
- **ACE inhibitors or ARBs**: Start by age 10 (or earlier if cardiomyopathy detected)
- **Beta-blockers**: For heart failure management
- **Cardiac MRI**: Annual monitoring from age 10
- **ECG/Echocardiogram**: Annual from diagnosis

### Respiratory Management
- **Pulmonary function tests**: Baseline from age 5-6, every 6-12 months
- **Non-invasive ventilation (NIV)**: When FVC < 50% or sleep hypoventilation
- **Cough assist devices**: Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation
- **Vaccination**: Influenza, pneumococcal, COVID-19

### Rehabilitation
- **Physical therapy**: Stretching, range of motion, submaximal exercise
- **Occupational therapy**: ADL adaptations, upper limb function
- **Orthoses**: AFOs for ankle contractures, standing frames
- **Wheelchair**: Power wheelchair assessment when ambulation declines

### Orthopedic
- **Scoliosis surgery**: Consider when Cobb angle > 20° and progressive
- **Fracture management**: Low-threshold for evaluation and treatment
- **Bisphosphonates**: For steroid-induced osteoporosis

## Emerging Therapies

### FDA-Approved Therapies
- **Exon skipping**: Eteplirsen (exon 51), Golodirsen (exon 53), Viltolarsen (exon 53), Casimersen (exon 45)
- **Stop codon readthrough**: Ataluren (conditional approval in EU for nonsense mutations)
- **Gene therapy**: Delandistrogene moxeparvovec (micro-dystrophin AAV gene therapy, accelerated approval 2023)

### Pipeline Therapies
- **Next-generation gene therapy**: Optimized micro-dystrophin constructs
- **CRISPR gene editing**: Exon deletion/reframing strategies
- **Utrophin upregulation**: Compensatory protein strategy
- **Anti-fibrotic agents**: Targeting muscle fibrosis
- **Stem cell therapy**: Under investigation

## Prognosis

- **Without treatment**: Death typically in late teens to early 20s from respiratory/cardiac failure
- **With current care**: Survival into 30s-40s with comprehensive multidisciplinary management
- **Quality of life**: Improved with early intervention, assistive technology, and psychosocial support

## Key Points

- DMD is the most common fatal genetic disorder diagnosed in childhood
- Serum CK is the initial screening test; genetic testing confirms diagnosis
- Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of pharmacologic management
- Multidisciplinary care (cardiac, respiratory, orthopedic, rehabilitation) is essential
- Gene-targeted therapies are transforming the treatment landscape
- Carrier females should be screened for cardiac involvement
