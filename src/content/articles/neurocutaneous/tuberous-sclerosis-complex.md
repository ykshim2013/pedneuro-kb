## Definition

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic multisystem disorder characterized by hamartomatous growths in multiple organs, most notably the brain, skin, kidneys, heart, and lungs. It results from mutations in the *TSC1* or *TSC2* genes, which encode hamartin and tuberin, respectively.

## Epidemiology

- **Birth incidence**: ~1 in 6,000-10,000 live births
- **Prevalence**: ~1 in 20,000
- **Inheritance**: Autosomal dominant with variable expressivity
- **De novo mutations**: ~65-75% of cases
- **Penetrance**: Nearly 100%, but expression highly variable

## Genetics and Molecular Biology

### TSC1 and TSC2 Genes

| Feature | TSC1 | TSC2 |
|---------|------|------|
| Chromosome | 9q34.13 | 16p13.3 |
| Protein | Hamartin | Tuberin |
| Mutation frequency | ~20-30% | ~60-70% |
| Phenotype severity | Generally milder | Generally more severe |
| NMI (no mutation identified) | ~10-15% of clinically diagnosed cases | |

### mTOR Pathway

The hamartin-tuberin complex acts as a critical negative regulator of the **mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)** pathway:

1. **Normal function**: TSC1/TSC2 complex → inhibits Rheb → suppresses mTORC1 → controlled cell growth
2. **In TSC**: Loss of TSC1/TSC2 function → constitutive mTORC1 activation → uncontrolled cell growth, proliferation, and hamartoma formation
3. **Therapeutic target**: mTOR inhibitors (everolimus, sirolimus) directly target the underlying pathway hyperactivation

## Diagnostic Criteria (2021 Updated International TSC Consensus)

The 2021 update by Northrup et al. (*Pediatric Neurology*, 2021; PMID 34399110) revised the diagnostic criteria and surveillance/management recommendations:

### Genetic Diagnostic Criteria
- **Definite diagnosis**: Identification of a pathogenic variant in *TSC1* or *TSC2* is sufficient regardless of clinical findings

### Clinical Diagnostic Criteria

**Major Features:**
1. Hypomelanotic macules (≥3, at least 5 mm diameter)
2. Angiofibromas (≥3) or fibrous cephalic plaque
3. Ungual fibromas (≥2)
4. Shagreen patch
5. Multiple retinal hamartomas
6. **Multiple cortical tubers and/or radial migration lines** *(revised 2021 — replaced the more general term "cortical dysplasias")*
7. Subependymal nodules (SEN)
8. Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA)
9. Cardiac rhabdomyoma
10. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)
11. Angiomyolipomas (≥2)

**Minor Features:**
1. "Confetti" skin lesions
2. Dental enamel pits (≥3)
3. Intraoral fibromas (≥2)
4. Retinal achromic patch
5. Multiple renal cysts
6. Nonrenal hamartomas
7. **Sclerotic bone lesions** *(reinstated as minor criterion in 2021 update)*

**Definite diagnosis**: 2 major features OR 1 major + ≥2 minor features
**Possible diagnosis**: 1 major feature OR ≥2 minor features

## Neurological Manifestations

### Cortical Tubers
- Present in >80% of patients
- Disorganized cortical architecture with dysplastic neurons and giant cells
- Location and number correlate with seizure severity and cognitive outcomes
- **MRI**: T2/FLAIR hyperintense, may calcify with age

### Subependymal Nodules (SEN)
- Present in ~80% of patients
- Small, calcified nodules lining the lateral ventricles
- Usually asymptomatic
- **CT**: Calcified nodular densities along ventricular walls

### Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA)
- Occurs in 5-20% of TSC patients
- Typically near the foramen of Monro
- Can cause obstructive hydrocephalus
- **Management**: Surgical resection or mTOR inhibitor therapy — everolimus demonstrated significant SEGA volume reduction in the EXIST-1 trial (Franz et al., *NEJM*, 2013)

### Epilepsy
- Affects 80-90% of TSC patients
- **Infantile spasms**: Most common seizure type in first year (30-50%)
- **Focal seizures**: Most common overall seizure type
- **Lennox-Gastaut syndrome**: May develop in severe cases
- **Drug-resistant epilepsy**: Common (~60%)
- **Epilepsy surgery**: Consider for focal drug-resistant seizures with identifiable epileptogenic tuber

### TSC-Associated Neuropsychiatric Disorders (TAND)

The 2023 TANDem Consortium published international consensus recommendations for TAND identification and treatment (de Vries et al., *J Neurodevelopmental Disorders*, 2023; PMID 37710171):

**Prevalence:**
- **Intellectual disability**: ~50% (range: mild to severe)
- **Autism spectrum disorder**: 40-50%
- **ADHD**: 30-50%
- **Anxiety/mood disorders**: Common
- **Sleep disorders**: 50-60%
- **Behavioral difficulties**: Aggression, self-injury in severe cases

**2023 TAND Consensus Framework — Seven Natural Clusters:**
1. Autism-like cluster
2. Dysregulated behavior cluster
3. Eat/sleep cluster
4. Mood/anxiety cluster
5. Neuropsychological cluster
6. Overactive/impulsive cluster
7. Scholastic cluster

**Core Recommendation**: "Screen → Act → Repeat" — screen for TAND at least annually using structured assessment tools, act using appropriate next steps for evaluation and treatment, and repeat the process to ensure early identification and early intervention (de Vries et al., 2023).

## Dermatologic Manifestations

### Hypomelanotic Macules (Ash-Leaf Spots)
- Often the earliest sign, present at birth or early infancy
- Best visualized under **Wood's lamp** examination
- Oval or lance-shaped, typically on trunk and limbs

### Facial Angiofibromas
- Appear in early childhood (typically 3-5 years)
- Red-brown papules in butterfly distribution
- **Treatment**: Topical sirolimus (0.1-0.2%), laser therapy

### Shagreen Patch
- Connective tissue hamartoma on lower back/lumbosacral area

### Ungual Fibromas (Koenen Tumors)
- More common in adolescents/adults
- May require surgical excision if symptomatic

## Systemic Manifestations

### Renal
- **Angiomyolipomas**: 55-75% of patients, risk of hemorrhage
- **Polycystic kidney disease**: When TSC2/PKD1 contiguous gene deletion
- **Renal cell carcinoma**: Rare but increased risk
- **Management**: mTOR inhibitors for growing AMLs > 3 cm; embolization for acute hemorrhage

### Cardiac
- **Cardiac rhabdomyomas**: Often detected prenatally, may be first sign of TSC
- Usually regress spontaneously during infancy/childhood

### Pulmonary
- **LAM**: Almost exclusively in adult females
- **Multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia (MMPH)**: Both sexes

## Surveillance Recommendations (2021 Updated Consensus)

Per the 2021 updated consensus (Northrup et al., 2021):

| Organ System | Investigation | Frequency |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| Brain MRI | SEGA monitoring | Every 1-3 years until age 25 |
| EEG | Seizure assessment | At diagnosis; as clinically indicated |
| TAND screening | Structured assessment | **At least annually** (2021/2023 update) |
| Renal MRI | AML monitoring | Every 1-3 years lifelong |
| Echocardiogram | Rhabdomyoma | At diagnosis; every 1-3 years in childhood, then every 3-5 years |
| Dermatology | Skin assessment | Annual |
| Ophthalmology | Retinal exam | At diagnosis; every 1-3 years |
| Dental | Enamel pits, fibromas | Every 6 months |
| Pulmonary CT | LAM screening | Baseline at age 18 in females; every 5-10 years |

## Treatment

### mTOR Inhibitors
- **Everolimus**: FDA-approved for SEGA (2010) and renal AML (2012) in TSC
- **Sirolimus**: Used off-label, particularly for LAM and skin lesions
- **Topical sirolimus**: For facial angiofibromas (0.1-0.2%)
- **Mechanism**: Directly targets the underlying mTOR pathway hyperactivation

### Epilepsy Management
- **Vigabatrin**: First-line for infantile spasms in TSC (Level A evidence)
- **Other AEDs**: Standard approach for focal seizures
- **Epilepsy surgery**: For drug-resistant focal epilepsy with identifiable tuber
- **Everolimus for refractory seizures**: The EXIST-3 postextension phase showed sustained efficacy as adjunctive therapy — seizure response rate improved from 31% at week 18 to 57.7% at 2 years, with median seizure frequency reduction of 56.9% at 2 years (Franz et al., *Epilepsia*, 2021)
- **Ketogenic diet**: May be beneficial in drug-resistant cases

### Everolimus Long-Term Safety (EXIST-3 Postextension)
Per Franz et al. (*Epilepsia*, 2021; PMID 34693520):
- After ~2 years of treatment, 64.8% had stable or improved seizure status
- 18.9% were seizure-free during the postextension phase
- Grade 3/4 adverse events: 40.2%
- Discontinuation due to adverse events: 13%
- Benefit-risk ratio improves with ongoing treatment

## Key Points

- TSC is caused by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2, leading to mTOR pathway hyperactivation
- The 2021 updated consensus refined diagnostic criteria, notably replacing "cortical dysplasias" with "multiple cortical tubers and/or radial migration lines" and reinstating sclerotic bone lesions as a minor criterion (Northrup et al., 2021)
- Epilepsy is the most common neurological manifestation; vigabatrin is first-line for infantile spasms
- The 2023 TAND Consortium established a "Screen → Act → Repeat" framework with seven natural TAND clusters for systematic neuropsychiatric management (de Vries et al., 2023)
- Everolimus is disease-modifying therapy targeting the underlying molecular defect, with sustained efficacy for both SEGA and refractory seizures over 2+ years (Franz et al., 2021)
- Lifelong multidisciplinary surveillance per the 2021 updated consensus is essential
- TAND screening should be performed at least annually using structured assessment tools
