## Definition

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic multisystem disorder characterized by hamartomatous growths in multiple organs, most notably the brain, skin, kidneys, heart, and lungs. It results from mutations in the *TSC1* or *TSC2* genes, which encode hamartin and tuberin, respectively.

## Epidemiology

- **Birth incidence**: ~1 in 6,000-10,000 live births
- **Prevalence**: ~1 in 20,000
- **Inheritance**: Autosomal dominant with variable expressivity
- **De novo mutations**: ~65-75% of cases
- **Penetrance**: Nearly 100%, but expression highly variable

## Genetics and Molecular Biology

### TSC1 and TSC2 Genes

| Feature | TSC1 | TSC2 |
|---------|------|------|
| Chromosome | 9q34.13 | 16p13.3 |
| Protein | Hamartin | Tuberin |
| Mutation frequency | ~20-30% | ~60-70% |
| Phenotype severity | Generally milder | Generally more severe |
| NMI (no mutation identified) | ~10-15% of clinically diagnosed cases | |

### mTOR Pathway

The hamartin-tuberin complex acts as a critical negative regulator of the **mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)** pathway:

1. **Normal function**: TSC1/TSC2 complex → inhibits Rheb → suppresses mTORC1 → controlled cell growth
2. **In TSC**: Loss of TSC1/TSC2 function → constitutive mTORC1 activation → uncontrolled cell growth, proliferation, and hamartoma formation
3. **Therapeutic target**: mTOR inhibitors (everolimus, sirolimus) can reverse this pathway hyperactivation

## Diagnostic Criteria (2021 Updated International TSC Consensus)

### Genetic Diagnostic Criteria
- **Definite diagnosis**: Identification of a pathogenic variant in *TSC1* or *TSC2* (sufficient regardless of clinical findings)

### Clinical Diagnostic Criteria

**Major Features:**
1. Hypomelanotic macules (≥3, at least 5 mm diameter)
2. Angiofibromas (≥3) or fibrous cephalic plaque
3. Ungual fibromas (≥2)
4. Shagreen patch
5. Multiple retinal hamartomas
6. Cortical dysplasias (includes tubers and cerebral white matter radial migration lines)
7. Subependymal nodules (SEN)
8. Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA)
9. Cardiac rhabdomyoma
10. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)
11. Angiomyolipomas (≥2)

**Minor Features:**
1. "Confetti" skin lesions
2. Dental enamel pits (≥3)
3. Intraoral fibromas (≥2)
4. Retinal achromic patch
5. Multiple renal cysts
6. Nonrenal hamartomas
7. Sclerotic bone lesions

**Definite diagnosis**: 2 major features OR 1 major + ≥2 minor features
**Possible diagnosis**: 1 major feature OR ≥2 minor features

## Neurological Manifestations

### Cortical Tubers
- Present in >80% of patients
- Disorganized cortical architecture with dysplastic neurons and giant cells
- Location and number correlate with seizure severity and cognitive outcomes
- **MRI**: T2/FLAIR hyperintense, may calcify with age

### Subependymal Nodules (SEN)
- Present in ~80% of patients
- Small, calcified nodules lining the lateral ventricles
- Usually asymptomatic
- **CT**: Calcified nodular densities along ventricular walls

### Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA)
- Occurs in 5-20% of TSC patients
- Typically near the foramen of Monro
- Can cause obstructive hydrocephalus
- **Management**: Surgical resection or mTOR inhibitor therapy (everolimus)

### Epilepsy
- Affects 80-90% of TSC patients
- **Infantile spasms**: Most common seizure type in first year (30-50%)
- **Focal seizures**: Most common overall seizure type
- **Lennox-Gastaut syndrome**: May develop in severe cases
- **Drug-resistant epilepsy**: Common (~60%)
- **Epilepsy surgery**: Consider for focal drug-resistant seizures with identifiable epileptogenic tuber

### TSC-Associated Neuropsychiatric Disorders (TAND)
- **Intellectual disability**: ~50% (range: mild to severe)
- **Autism spectrum disorder**: 40-50%
- **ADHD**: 30-50%
- **Anxiety/mood disorders**: Common
- **Sleep disorders**: 50-60%
- **Behavioral difficulties**: Aggression, self-injury in severe cases
- **Recommendation**: Annual TAND screening using structured assessment tools

## Dermatologic Manifestations

### Hypomelanotic Macules (Ash-Leaf Spots)
- Often the earliest sign, present at birth or early infancy
- Best visualized under **Wood's lamp** examination
- Oval or lance-shaped, typically on trunk and limbs

### Facial Angiofibromas
- Appear in early childhood (typically 3-5 years)
- Red-brown papules in butterfly distribution (nose and cheeks)
- Progressive without treatment
- **Treatment**: Topical sirolimus (0.1-0.2%), laser therapy

### Shagreen Patch
- Connective tissue hamartoma
- Irregular, slightly elevated, orange-peel textured plaque
- Usually on lower back/lumbosacral area

### Ungual Fibromas (Koenen Tumors)
- Flesh-colored growths at nail base
- More common in adolescents/adults
- May require surgical excision if symptomatic

## Systemic Manifestations

### Renal
- **Angiomyolipomas**: 55-75% of patients, risk of hemorrhage
- **Polycystic kidney disease**: When TSC2/PKD1 contiguous gene deletion
- **Renal cell carcinoma**: Rare but increased risk
- **Management**: mTOR inhibitors for growing AMLs > 3 cm; embolization for acute hemorrhage

### Cardiac
- **Cardiac rhabdomyomas**: Often detected prenatally, may be first sign of TSC
- Usually regress spontaneously during infancy/childhood
- Can cause arrhythmias or outflow obstruction in neonates

### Pulmonary
- **LAM**: Almost exclusively in adult females
- **Multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia (MMPH)**: Both sexes

## Surveillance Recommendations (2021 Updated Consensus)

| Organ System | Investigation | Frequency |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| Brain MRI | SEGA monitoring | Every 1-3 years until age 25 |
| EEG | Seizure assessment | At diagnosis; as clinically indicated |
| Renal MRI | AML monitoring | Every 1-3 years lifelong |
| Echocardiogram | Rhabdomyoma | At diagnosis; every 1-3 years in childhood |
| Dermatology | Skin assessment | Annual |
| Ophthalmology | Retinal exam | At diagnosis; every 1-3 years |
| Neuropsychology | TAND assessment | At diagnosis; annual screening |
| Pulmonary CT | LAM screening | Baseline at age 18 in females; every 5-10 years |

## Treatment

### mTOR Inhibitors
- **Everolimus**: FDA-approved for SEGA (2010) and renal AML (2012) in TSC
- **Sirolimus**: Off-label use, particularly for LAM
- **Topical sirolimus**: For facial angiofibromas
- **Mechanism**: Directly targets the underlying mTOR pathway hyperactivation
- **Side effects**: Stomatitis, immunosuppression, hyperlipidemia, amenorrhea

### Epilepsy Management
- **Vigabatrin**: First-line for infantile spasms in TSC (Level A evidence)
- **Other AEDs**: Standard approach for focal seizures
- **Epilepsy surgery**: For drug-resistant focal epilepsy with identifiable tuber
- **mTOR inhibitors**: Everolimus as adjunctive therapy for refractory seizures (EXIST-3 trial)
- **Ketogenic diet**: May be beneficial in drug-resistant cases

## Key Points

- TSC is caused by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2, leading to mTOR pathway hyperactivation
- Genetic testing provides definitive diagnosis regardless of clinical features
- Epilepsy is the most common neurological manifestation, often presenting with infantile spasms
- Vigabatrin is first-line treatment for infantile spasms in TSC
- mTOR inhibitors (everolimus) are disease-modifying therapy targeting the underlying molecular defect
- Lifelong multidisciplinary surveillance is essential
- TAND screening should be performed annually
